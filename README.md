# Starter-Kit

The goal of this project is to provide a strong and efficient starter to quickly start developments on new projects

To access the documentation you must have [docsify] installed on your system.

```bash
# use npm
npm i docsify-cli -g
# or yarn
yarn global add docsify-cli
```

then simply run

```bash
# you may replace the port by another of your choosing
# if not defined it will use the port 3000 
# which may get it conflict with the application itself
docsify serve docs -p 4000
```
